A key limitation of kinetic modeling is the large number of parameters that it requires. If we think back to the reversible Michaelis-Menten with noncompetitive inhibition simulation we did in yesterday's session, one flux in the network was determined by the following equation:"

When we are doing kinetic modeling, we provide sets of parameters and initial concentrations that allow us to calculate fluxes which, in combination with the network architecture given by the stoichiometric matrix, give us the rates of change of the concentrations of our metabolites. This gives us a rich and detailed view of the dynamics of the system we're looking at and, importantly, it is a very attractive way of modeling biochemical systems because it hews closely to our understanding of how these systems *actually* work.

    "FBA is typically deployed in cases where our network is *underdetermined*; that is, we have insufficient flux information available to come up with a unique flux map. Instead, there are multiple flux maps that are all consistent with the constraints provided. All of the viable flux maps that are consistent with our constraints constitute what we'll call the **solution space**. If this space is very large, we can't extract much value from it. So, FBA uses linear optimization techniques to reduce the size of this space. We do this by specifying an objective function, which is a single or a linear combination of fluxes in our network, that we would like to maximize or minimize. Any flux in the network can be a part of our objective.\n",

    "In real FBA studies with large-scale networks, the most common choice is the maximization of biomass accumulation. If biomass accumulation has been measured and can therefore be set as a constraint, the minimization of flux is a common choice. In this case, we'll start off by trying (as much as possible in FBA) by *not* specifying an objective. One way to accomplish this is by setting our objective as the maximization/minimization of a flux we've constrained the value of. We'll choose R1."
